        <h3>More About Me</h3>
        <p>I graduated from Texas A & M University with a BA in International Studies and English.
        I currently work full-time in the insurance world. </p>
        <p>I have been interested in learning
         about computers and coding for a long time. <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/" target="\_blank">Thinkful</a>
        has offered me the opportunity to dive into web development. My interest and
        passion grows with each lesson successfully accomplished. </p>
        <p>I love a good puzzle and a few tough problems or mysteries to solve! I always love learning something new, 
            and I enjoy crafting and cooking, especially when I have the time to experiment!
