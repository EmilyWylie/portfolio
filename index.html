        <h3>More About Me</h3>
        <p>I graduated from Texas A & M University with a BA in International Studies and English.
        I currently work full-time in the insurance world.</p> 
        <p>One of my favorite things about any kind of work
        opportunity is getting to work on a team that is always striving for improvement through innovations
        and ideas. I love the creativity that comes from working with peers and mentors, which always has me 
        thinking outside the box. </p>
        <p>I have been interested in learning about computers and coding for a long time. 
          <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/" target="\_blank">Thinkful</a> has offered me the opportunity to dive into web development. My interest and
        passion grows with each lesson successfully completed. I love knowing that I will never be bored and never be done learning. </p>
        <p>I love a good puzzle and a few tough problems or mysteries to solve! I always love learning something new, 
            whether it's a new recipe or ingredient or trying out a new crafting skill. And I would never turn down the 
          opportunity to relax with good friends and family over a cup of coffee or a margarita!</p>
